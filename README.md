# Web App 3 Plugin: Rename Participant Plugin

This plugin allows hosts to rename participants in the participant list. When
the host clicks the "Rename Participant" entry in the participant action menu, a
modal appears. The new name can be provided and will be set to the related
patient.

## How to use

A additional entry appears in the participant action menu in participant list.

<div align='center'>

</div>

This item opens a dialog to rename to participant.

![select department](./docs/images/rename_participant.png)

</div>

<div align='center'>

![select department](./docs/images/renamed_participant.png)

</div>

## Limitations

  plugin.
- Technically the overlay_text is overwritten and shown in the participant list,
  the actual display name does not change.

    not appear for these participants.

  ## Run for development

  - To be able to build the plugin, you need to comply with the following versions
    or higher:

    | NodeJS   | NPM     |
    | -------- | ------- |
    | v20.12.2 | v10.5.0 |

  - Install all the dependencies:

  ```bash
  $ npm i
  ```

  - Run the dev environment:

  ```bash
  $ npm start
  ```

  The plugin will be served from https://localhost:5173 (visit that page and
  accept the self-signed certificates), but you should access it thought the Web
  App 3 URL. You have more information about how to configure your environment in
  the
  [Developer Portal: Setup guide for plugin developers](https://developer.pexip.com/docs/plugins/webapp-3/setup-guide-for-plugin-developers).

  ## Build for production

  To create a package, you will need to first install all the dependencies:

  ```bash
  $ npm i
  ```

  And now to create the package itself:

  ```bash
  $ npm run build
  ```

  Congrats! Your package is ready and it will be available in the `dist` folder.
  The next step is to create a Web App3 branding and copy `dist` into that
  branding.
